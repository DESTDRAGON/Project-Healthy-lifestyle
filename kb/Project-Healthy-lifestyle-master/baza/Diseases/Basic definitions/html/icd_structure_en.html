<p>The full ICD-11 document includes an introduction, classification, instructions for completing a certificate of perinatal mortality, regulatory definitions, nomenclature provisions and other sections. We describe the structure and principles of classification.<br>
<br>
In the classification of the ICD-11, the statistics are grouped into the following groups:<br>
    -Epidemic diseases;<br>
    -constitutional or common diseases; <br>
    -local diseases grouped by anatomical localization; <br>
    -developmental diseases; <br>
    -injuries. <br>
<br>
The classification has a four-level hierarchical structure. Records classification have codes and verbal transcript. The classification uses an alphanumeric coding system. The structure and classification codes are as follows:<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
<br>
Only 27 classes. <br>
The code of each class is a pair of codes defining the range of codes included in the class. <br>
Class code is presented in the form: letter + two numbers - letter + two numbers. For example: A00-B99, C00-D48, K00-K93. <br>
<br>
Blocks Rubrics <br>
<br>
Classes ICD-11 are divided into homogeneous blocks. Block code in the form of a letter + two digits or through an indication of the range. For example: B99, C00-C97, K00-K14. <br>
Three-digit headings <br>
<br>
View code: letter + two numbers. For example: C02, K00. <br>
Four-digit subheadings <br>
<br>
Subcategory code in the form: letter + two numbers. numeral. The code uses the point after which there is a figure specifying the disease for a three-digit heading. For example: C02.1, K00.3. <br>
<br>
General example. Let us consider in detail the chain H60-H95 H80-H83 H80 H80.2 <br>
